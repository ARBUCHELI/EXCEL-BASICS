# EXPLORING DATA

* Introduction to Exploring Data
--------------------------------
1 min
Excel lets us store, organize, and analyze our data all in the same place. This makes Excel a great one-stop-shop for exploring a dataset prior to performing a formal analysis. In this 
lesson, we’ll cover three standard Excel methods for data exploration:

	. calculating averages and other statistics using formulas

	. organizing data using sorting

	. zooming in on the data we care about by filtering

Each exercise in this lesson will come with an interactive Excel spreadsheet for you to download. The spreadsheet will give you instructions to practice what you’ve learned, provide 
hints, and give feedback on your answers.

Even old hands at Excel sometimes get stuck on seemingly “simple” tasks, so if you get stuck, please consult the solutions or ask a question in the forums, even if you think you “should” 
be able to do it.

* Introduction to Excel
-----------------------
1 min
Let’s start by taking a tour of the Excel interface! When you first open up Excel, the sheer number of features can be a little overwhelming. But once you understand the structure behind 
Excel’s layout, you can find the features you need and put the flexibility of Excel to use.

Excel is structured around two basic purposes:

	1. Storing data and analyses of data

	2. Performing analyses of data

Let’s walk through the schematic of Excel in the learning environment to the right. At the bottom of the schematic are tabs corresponding to three sheets named Sheet1, Sheet2, and Sheet3.

The actual sheets appear above the tabs with the sheet names. The sheets are where Excel stores data tables and the results of data analysis, like charts or calculations. The data 
analysis tools themselves are stored above the sheets.

The formula bar is directly above the sheets. This is where you can view and edit any calculations you are using in your analysis.

The area above the formula bar displays different analytics options depending on which tab is open. In the schematic, the Home tab is open and the Insert and Data tabs are closed. Each 
icon on a tab is connected to some analytics function like sorting a table or creating a chart.

Depending on your version of Excel, icons may appear differently, but they should always be in the same location. We’ll give you directions in each exercise to find the tools you need!

* Summarizing Numeric Data
--------------------------
6 min
Let’s start by exploring numeric data! In the learning environment, we’ve loaded a dataset containing the number of new cars produced in the US by year (from the Bureau of Transportation 
Statistics). Often, exploring numeric data starts with answering basic statistical questions about the data such as

	. what is the largest number of new cars in a year?

	. what is the smallest number of new cars in a year?

	. what is the average number of new cars in a year?

Excel can help us answer all of these. But first, we’ll have to know a little more about how cells in a spreadsheet connect to each other. The connections between cells are based on cell 
“addresses” or “references”.

Cell addresses are made up of a column letter followed by a row number. For example, the cell containing the number 10 in the following image is named B2 since it is in column B and row 
2. The number 10 is the content or value of the cell.rows A through C and columns 1 through 3 of Excel with cell B2 highlighted and containing the number 10

In addition to numbers, cells can also contain formulas, which are how we’ll calculate our maximum, minimum, and average. A formula in Excel always starts with the = sign, so Excel knows 
that it should do some kind of computation.

For example, since B2 contains the number 10, the formula =2+B2 would produce the value 12, since 2+10 = 12. The cell name B2 gets replaced by its value when Excel does the computation.

We can also do subtraction, division, and multiplication in formulas using

	. - for subtraction

	. / for division

	. * for multiplication

This last one might seem like an unusual symbol, but it is pretty commonly used for multiplication on computers.

Here’s an example of using * for multiplication. What would you change if you wanted to multiply B2 by 3?

rows A through C and columns 1 through 3 of Excel with cell B2 containing the number 10 and cell C2 containing the formula =2*B2rows A through C and columns 1 through 3 of Excel with cell 
B2 containing the number 10 and cell C2 containing the number 20

Now, you might be thinking to yourself that you could multiply 2 by 10 without a spreadsheet. That’s right! But the magic of Excel formulas is that they update automatically when data 
changes. If the cell B2 was changed to contain the number 4, the cell C2 would automatically update to contain the number 8, since 2*4 = 8. These dynamic formulas are the real power of 
Excel since they let us automatically update analyses with new data.

* Ranges of Cells
-----------------
To calculate an average we need to reference a whole collection of cells instead of a single cell at a time. To reference a range of data, we type the name of the first cell in the range 
(usually the top-left cell), a colon, and then the name of the last cell (usually the bottom-right cell).

For example, the range B1:C4 includes the cells in Columns B-C and Rows 1-4.rows A through C and columns 1 through 8 of Excel with cell A1 containing the formula =B1:C4 and the cells 
B1-B4 and C1 through C4 highlighted

To calculate the maximum, minimum, and average of this range we use special Excel functions =MAX(), =MIN(), and =AVERAGE(), and we we put the range containing the data between the 
parentheses.

In the example in the learning environment, the data is contained in the range B2:B7, so the full formulas for calculating these three statistics are

	. =MAX(B2:B7)

	. =MIN(B2:B7)

	. =AVERAGE(B2:B7)

To display the average in cell B8, we

	1. Select cell B8

	2. Type the formula into the cell

	3. Select return or enter

You can watch the full process in the slideshow in the learning environment. When you are ready to practice this yourself, follow the next set of instructions!

	. When you’re done with the exercises, come back here and answer the reflection question!

Reflection question: when you restricted the range for the average, the average increased. Why do you think that happened, and when would you prefer to use one average over the other?

* Check Answer
--------------
Restricting the range for the average removed the first five years, which had lower numbers of new SUVs overall. Removing these lower numbers increased the average. The larger average is 
more reflective of current trends (since 2013, every year has had at least 1.5 million new SUVs produced.)

* Transform Data
----------------
5 min
The raw data we get often isn’t in precisely the form we would like to analyze. For example, our new vehicle data contains the number of new vehicles for each type of vehicle, but what if 
we wanted to see each type as a percent of total new vehicles instead?

We could calculate percentages one cell at a time using individual formulas, but this would result in a lot of time writing formulas instead of analyzing our data. Also, if we ever 
decided to change our analysis slightly, we’d be stuck updating each formula individually again. Fortunately, Excel lets us move, or drag, formulas while automatically updating cell 
references.

Let’s take a look at what this means. Suppose the cell B2 contains the formula =A4. If we move this formula from B2 to D1, we moved the formula two columns to the right and one row up. 
Excel then updated the formula from =A4 to =C3 following the same “path”: two columns to the right and one row up. A way to think of it is that Excel moved everything two steps over and 
one step up.

a screenshot of an Excel table with columns A-D and rows 1-4. Cell B2 has the formula =A4. There are arrows demonstrating this formula being moved three columns over and one row up, so 
that cell D1 has formula C3.

Sometimes, we won’t want the column or row to update. For example, let’s take a look at calculating the percentages of the new vehicle data in the next table.

	A		B			C
1	Vehicle type	# of new vehicles	Percentage
2	car		1000	
3	SUV		1500	
4	truck		5000	
5	TOTAL:		7500	

We can calculate the first percentage in C by dividing the number of new cars by the total number of new vehicles. In Excel, we would type the formula = B2/B5 in the cell C2.

	A		B			C
1	Vehicle type	# of new vehicles	Percentage
2	car		1000			=B2/B5
3	SUV		1500	
4	truck		5000	
5	TOTAL:		7500	


What happens when we move this formula to the cell C3? The column stayed the same, and the row moved one cell down. Excel will update the references in the formula =B2/B5 to follow the 
same path:

	. B2 becomes B3

	. B5 becomes B6

Now the cell C3 will have the formula =B3/B6.

	A		B			C
1	Vehicle type	# of new vehicles	Percentage
2	car		1000			=B2/B5
3	SUV		1500			=B3/B6
4	truck		5000	
5	TOTAL:		7500	

This isn’t what we want to calculate! The formula =B3/B6 takes the number of new SUVs in B3 and divides it by whatever is in cell B6, not by the total which is in cell B5.

We want Excel to update the reference B2 to B3, so that we’re calculating the SUV percentage. But we don’t want Excel to update the reference to B5, since the total stays the same no 
matter which vehicle type we’re working with.

To stop Excel from updating this row, we need to place a $ before the original row reference. The first formula in C2 becomes =B2/B$5. When we move it down to C3 it updates to =B3/B$5. 
This takes the number of new SUVs and divides it by the total, which is what we want to do!

	A		B			C
1	Vehicle type	# of new vehicles	Percentage
2	car		1000			=B2/B$5
3	SUV		1500			=B3/B$5
4	truck		5000	
5	TOTAL:		7500
	
Note that if we wanted to stop the column from updating instead of the row, we would need to put the $ sign in front of the column letter in the formula instead of the row number.

* Errors and Best Practices
---------------------------
Forgetting to use a $ when necessary sometimes results in an Excel error. These errors are displayed in the cell containing the reference.

The two most common errors are #DIV/0! and #VALUE!. Let’s look at how these could occur in our example, where Excel updated the percentage formula to =B3/B6, pointing to a cell B6 that 
isn’t in our table.

The #DIV/0! error indicates that Excel is trying to divide by 0. This could happen because the cell B6 contains a 0 or, more likely, because the cell B6 is empty. Excel assumes that empty 
cells are the same as 0.

The #VALUE! error likely indicates that the cell B6 contains some non-numeric value that Excel cannot use in the mathematical formula =B3/B6.

Even if no errors appear, our cell references might still be updating in a way we don’t want. If there was a nonzero number in cell B6, Excel would calculate =B3/B6 without an error. 
Unless we’re careful, we could use the wrong number in our analysis without realizing it.

In general, it is always good practice to audit every formula we intend to move, looking at every cell referenced to ask:

	1. Should the row of this reference update when moved up/down?

	2. Should the column of this reference update when moved left/right?

Question: how do new cars produced in 2019 compare to the other varieties, given what you calculated in the range I27:I31?

* Check Our Answer
------------------
New cars are at only 67% of their 2015 production level, whiles new vans are at 85% and all other vehicle types are over 100% of their 2015 levels.

We have to be careful, however, because we are comparing each type to its own 2015 baseline. For example, while pickup trucks in 2019 are at 140% of their 2015 level, there are still only 
about half as many pickup trucks being produced as there are cars.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Sorting Data
--------------
4 min
Since Excel is often used to store and display data, we can scroll to explore, too. If the data is randomly arranged, it’s hard to get any insight by just scrolling. But if the data is 
organized in a predictable way, we might be able to spot patterns that can guide our more formal analysis later on.

For example, look at the tornado data in the learning environment (from the National Weather Service). Notice that it is unsorted and difficult to make sense of. Once it is sorted, 
however, we can see all tornado measurements for each state together. This makes it much easier to visually inspect.

To sort a table of data in Excel by one of its columns, select a cell containing data for that column and then choose an order for sorting from the Sort & Filter menu on the Home tab.

For example, here’s how we would sort this tornado data alphabetically by state:An image of the Sort menu in Excle

This method would result in a table starting with the tornados in Florida, since F comes before M and O alphabetically.

The option to sort A to Z or Z to A will only be displayed for text-based data. For numeric and time data, the options are Sort Smallest to Largest; or dates, Sort Oldest to Newest and 
vice versa. Sometimes, Excel might interpret the data type incorrectly and display the wrong option. We’ll show you how to fix that in a later lesson.

Often, we want to sort by more than one column. For example, we might want to organize our tornado data so that all the tornados in each state are grouped together and only then sorted by 
date. The natural thing to try would be to sort by state and then sort by date. But, in case this wasn’t already complicated enough, we actually need to use the reverse order.

This might seem unintuitive, but let’s look at a small example to see why this happens. Consider the following table:

Date	State
1/4/20	FL
2/5/20	AL
1/31/20	FL
1/11/20	AL
2/6/20	FL

If we sort newest-to-oldest by date, we’ll get the table rearranged by date:

Date	State
2/6/20	FL
2/5/20	AL
1/31/20	FL
1/11/20	AL
1/4/20	FL

When we sort by state next, AL will come before FL. But which of the two AL rows will be first?

The way Excel deals with cells that have the same value is by maintaining the order they were already in. Since we’ve already sorted by date from newest to oldest, the 2/5/20 row for AL 
will come before the 1/11/20 row. Here’s what the whole sorted table looks like:

Date	State
2/5/20	AL
1/11/20	AL
2/6/20	FL
1/31/20	FL
1/4/20	FL

In the learning environment, we’ve shown what happens if you sort a portion of this tornado dataset by time, and then by date, and then by state. When you’re ready to try this yourself, 
move on to the next set of instructions.

* Instructions
--------------
When you’re ready to practice what you’ve learned, download and work through our interactive exercise spreadsheet.

To allow you to sort freely, we’ve unlocked all cells of this spreadsheet. This is a great opportunity to practice Excel hygiene: do your best to only edit the cells indicated. If you 
think you might have accidentally erased some data, feel free to re-download the spreadsheet to start fresh!

If you get stuck, feel free to download our solutions spreadsheet.

Once you’ve finished, think about the next question.

Question: could we use sorting to figure out how many tornados occurred on a given date?

* Check Our Answer
------------------
Unfortunately, we can't. While sorting the data by date will group entries by date, we don't know for sure if different rows of this dataset correspond to different tornados. Even rows 
with different states or different times might correspond to the same tornado that has moved or grown. It is always important to not only think about the tools we have to analyze 
datasets, but also what limitations the dataset might impose.
